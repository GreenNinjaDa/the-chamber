# The Chamber

A level-based 3D survival game in the browser, built directly on WebGPU + WGSL with a small custom engine
(no Three.js / Babylon). Modeled on the approach of dgreenheck/tidewater.

## Game design

- Each level is a different, very novel situation the player must survive. There is no fixed rule, but most
  levels start the same way: over-the-shoulder third-person camera (Fortnite-like), WASD movement, inside a
  nondescript Portal-style test chamber with four white panelled walls and no roof.
- The core of the design is **surprise and humour**. Don't explain levels or give instructions up front
  (no theme names, no hint lines for now). Any on-screen text — end screens, and hints if they come back — is
  sarcastic or joking, may hint a little at the mechanics, and pop-culture references are welcome.
- **Level 1 — Darts** (`src/levels/darts/`): a giant rises over the south wall and blocks the sun. Five
  player-sized darts drop into the chamber and his hand hunts the player. The player survives by luring the
  hand onto darts until he has thrown **all five**; the hand gets faster after every grab. Each grab is a
  hover that tracks the player, then a gradual descent that locks its landing spot halfway down. If it lands
  on nothing, it immediately sweeps sideways along the floor at the player: a dart in its path is grabbed
  instead, otherwise the player is caught. If the giant grabs
  the player instead, they are thrown at the dartboard and must steer mid-flight (WASD) into the bullseye to
  survive — anything else is a loss.
- **Level 2 — Grenade** (`src/levels/grenade/`): junk (fridge, washing machine, bathtub, couch, mattress, crates,
  tires, a garden gnome...) crashes into the chamber, then a pineapple grenade with a blinking 10 s fuse. In direct line
  of sight (nothing between it and your chest) a blast is fatal anywhere in the chamber. Behind cover, damage =
  (safeDistance / d) ^ falloff × the average fraction getting through to head/chest/pelvis (walls block completely,
  per-junk pass-through,
  heavier = better cover); ≥1 kills, ≥0.35 knocks you down. Shrapnel (300 / 450 fragments) flies in straight lines,
  sticks in walls, junk and bodies, shoves what it hits, and kills the player on any hit. A red-rimmed hole (r 0.36 m, centre
  6.75 m up, above carrying reach) in the north wall lets you throw grenades out; throw speeds are tuned so
  neither grenade can be thrown over the 10 m walls from the floor. Survive the first and 1 s later a second
  grenade 1.5× the size arrives:
  behind even the flimsiest object you only live from 80% of the chamber's diagonal away. Survive both to win.
- Levels can tweak the chamber via `Level.chamber` (`ChamberOptions` in chamber.ts), e.g. a hole in the north wall.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server at http://127.0.0.1:5189 (hot reload)
- `npm run build` — type-check + static build into `dist/`
- Pushing to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Layout

- `src/main.ts` — game loop, title screen, the `LEVELS` list (`?level=N` starts at level N; N key after a win goes
  to the next level), level start/restart, dev hook
- `src/engine/` — renderer (primitive meshes, sun shadow map, MSAA, patterns), math (column-major,
  WebGPU clip space z ∈ [0,1]), input
- `src/shaders/*.wgsl` — shaders, imported with `?raw`. Surface patterns (panels, dartboard, blob, skin, sky)
  are ids in `Pattern` (renderer.ts) that must match the constants in scene.wgsl
- `src/engine/physics.ts` — Rapier wrapper: one `Physics` world per level attempt (created in main.ts with the
  chamber colliders), fixed 120 Hz stepping with pre/post-step hooks, dynamic bodies that draw themselves,
  usables, ray casts, collision groups (the player's body parts and capsule are excluded from queries)
- `src/game/` — shared pieces every level uses: chamber, player (Rapier character controller), over-the-shoulder
  camera, HUD (with crosshair), `interaction.ts` (crosshair targeting, E to use, hold left click to carry/drag,
  right-click to throw), `props.ts` (Lever, Button), `body.ts` (11-part rounded player body: skeleton + poses for drawing,
  and `PhysBody`, the active ragdoll that follows the animation with joint motors and per-part pose matching)
- `src/dev/sandbox.ts` — mechanics test room, opened with `?sandbox` (not a game level)
- `src/levels/level.ts` — the `Level` interface; each level gets its own folder under `src/levels/`

## Adding a level

Implement `Level` (update / draw / environment / obstacles / cameraShot), set `status` to `won` or `lost`
when it ends, and show the result with `hud.show(...)`. Levels can take over the camera by returning a
`CameraShot`, and take over the player by changing `player.mode`.

Shared mechanics available to levels (via `ctx`):
- `ctx.physics.addBox / addBall / addCylinder` — loose objects. Carried things are held 0.9–1.8 m in front of the
  chest with at most ~95 kg of lifting force (`MAX_CARRY_FORCE` in interaction.ts): light things are carried, a
  120 kg fridge can be tipped upright by one end but only dragged, never lifted clear. Pass `grabbable: false`
  for things the player shouldn't pick up.
- `new Lever(physics, pos, yaw, onToggle)` and `new Button(physics, pos, color, onPress)` for E-usable props;
  implement `Usable` and call `physics.registerUsable(collider, thing)` for custom ones.
- `trackedTargets()` — optional; returns things to flag on screen (pulsing red ring when visible, pulsing edge
  arrow when off screen), e.g. live grenades.
- `player.kill(launchVelocity, { violence?, origin? })` — comic death: the player goes limp as a ragdoll (don't use
  it for Darts). Violent deaths (violence = launch speed by default; ≥18 starts tearing joints, ~40 rips most of
  them) permanently dismember the body; `origin` makes parts nearer it more likely to come off.
  `player.tearApart(violence, origin)` does the same to an existing corpse.
- `player.knock(velocity, stunSeconds)` — shove the player loose; they go limp, tumble, then get back up.
  Hits do this automatically (thresholds at the top of player.ts): the head needs 6 m/s and 40 kg·m/s, the rest
  of the body 1.5× the speed and 5× the momentum. Loose objects count with their mass, walls/bars/scripted
  things as 50 kg, nothing heavier than 50 kg. Only head, chest and pelvis count against non-physics things.
- The player's movement capsule is wider than the body and never pushes things itself: walking pushes loose
  objects by hand (heavier = slower), and flying objects pass through the capsule to hit the real body.
- In scripted modes (`held`, `flying`, `stuck`, `splat`) the physical body is switched off and the pose is drawn
  directly; in `control` and `ragdoll` the body is drawn from physics.

## Testing without a visible browser

In dev builds `window.__game` exposes `step(seconds)` (fixed 60 Hz simulation steps, then one render),
`level`, `player` and `camera`. The browser pane throttles animation frames while hidden, so drive
play-tests through `__game.step` from the JS tool, and dispatch `KeyboardEvent`s on `window` for input.

## How to work on this project

- Work in small, verifiable steps. After each feature: run the dev server, open it in the browser pane,
  take a screenshot, and check the console for WebGPU validation errors before calling it done.
- Commit after every working step with a clear message so changes are easy to undo.
- Run `npm run build` before committing; it must pass with no TypeScript errors.
- Performance matters: target 60 fps on an RTX 5060 Ti at 1440p. Avoid per-frame allocations in hot loops.
- Keep features toggleable (settings panel or URL flags like `?noClouds`) so they can be isolated when debugging.
- Only use assets with clear licenses (CC0 / MIT / OFL) and record every one in `CREDITS.md`.
